==========
BUG REPORT
==========
o shift/reduce conflict in dot_parser.mly

==========
COMPATIBLE FEATURES WISH
==========
o "make install" should handle the graph editor
o Integrating viewGraph (contribution of Anne Pacalet)
  see Frama-C, directory src/gui/viewGraph
  Note: viewGraph uses lablgnomecanvas (and lablgtk2 of course)
o Better website Meilleures documentations "externes" (page web, FAQ, ...)
o It should be possible to specify the first vertex to visit in traversal 
  algorithm (suggestion of Fabrice Derepas)
o Implementations for graph with unlabeled vertices 
  (exactly like graph with unlabeled edges)
o Provide more bidirectional graph implementation:
  only Imperative.Digraph.ConcreteBidirectional exists at this day.
o Provide generic marks (instead of only integer marks)

==========
UNCOMPATIBLE FEATURES WISH (break compatibility with older version)
==========
o Type of [default] in [ORDERED_TYPE_DFT] should be [unit -> E.label]
  (suggestion of Benjamin Monate)
