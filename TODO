==========
COMPATIBLE FEATURES WISH
==========
o Improve the website
o It should be possible to specify the first vertex to visit in traversal 
  algorithm (suggestion of Fabrice Derepas)
o Implementations for graph with unlabeled vertices 
  (exactly like graph with unlabeled edges)
o Provide more bidirectional graph implementation:
  only Imperative.Digraph.ConcreteBidirectional exists at this day.
o Provide generic marks (instead of only integer marks)
